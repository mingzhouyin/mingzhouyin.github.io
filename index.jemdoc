== Biography
Mingzhou Yin is a doctoral student supervised by [http://people.ee.ethz.ch/~rsmith/ Prof. Roy S. Smith] in the Automatic Control Laboratory at ETH Zurich since February 2019. He has been supported by the project "Modeling, Identification and Control of Periodic Systems in Energy Applications" from the Swiss National Science Foundation. He received his MSc degree /cum laude/ in control & simulation at the Faculty of Aerospace Engineering, Delft University of Technology, the Netherlands in 2018. His master's thesis research is on envelope-​protected non-​linear control of over-​actuated aircraft in collaboration with Lockheed Martin. He received the joint bachelor’s degree in Mechanical Engineering at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China and the University of Hong Kong, China with first-​class honours in 2016. He was the recipient of the IEEE Control Systems Society Swiss Chapter Young Author Best Journal Paper Award and the Systems Identification and Adaptive Control Technical Committee Outstanding Student Paper Prize in 2023.
